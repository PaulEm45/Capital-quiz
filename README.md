<h1>Capital Quiz<h1> 

<h2>Purpose of the project<h2>

<p>This website is a simple question and answer page, where a quest on a capital city is displayed then after choosing their answer if its correct their score will add 10.<p>

<h2>User Stories</h2>

<h3>The home page</h3>

<p>The home page will give the user a straight up insight into the game.</p>


<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Header</h3>

<p>Within the header section i have added an icon to give the page some emphasis</p>

<h3>Main Content</h3>

<p>The content is very basic as to look at more how javascript is working.</p>

<h3>Footer</h3>

<p>The footer is not diplayed.</p>

<h3>Images</h3>

<p>The images used is the adapted icon from google icons.</p>

<h2>Future Features</h2>

<p>Future features i would hope to include would be a restart button that would reset the score on the page without a refresh.</p>

<h2>Typeography and Colour Scheme</h2>

<p>The original colour scheme was slightly brighter but when i passed the website through 'Lighthouse' it flagged some contrast issues. These have been changed to give extra accessability</p>

<h2>Wireframes</h2>

<p>I did not use wireframing in this website as i am from an architectural background and have trusted the pen and paper mock up however messy. This gives me an easy to refer to look even when not at the screen.</p>

<h2>Technology</h2>

<p>The technologies used in this website are HTML and CSS, and JavaScript; 'i found JavaScript a particular headache and feel that it is not my finest work' also media screen queries were not needed and the space is already responsive, i have also incorperated icons to make it more appeasing and aimiable. </p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<h3>Code Validation</h3>

<p>HTML-No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator.</p>

<p>CSS-No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator</p>

<p>Devtools - Console no problems were reported when playing the game all the way through.</p>

<p>JS-No major errors were returned when passing through JShint</p>


<h3>Test Cases</h3>

<p>When i first ran the html through the W3C Validation a few error popped up mainly linked to grammer and missing/extra parts put into the code</p>

<h3>Fixed Bugs</h3>

<p>I have being having some trouble with my code with elements not being defined, i have tried rectify this as one error was a reference error, i had 'next-btn' insted of just 'next'.</p>

<p>I have changed all the colour codes to hex to keep uniformity.</p>
